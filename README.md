# Cryptocurrencies
Utilizing Unsupervised Machine Learning techniques to analyze cryptocurrency data 
---

## Challenge Overview
---
This project implements unsupervised machine learning to create an analysis for prospective clients preparing to dive into the cryptocurrency market. The client, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolo for its customers. To provide clarification on the crypto universe to our client, we must create a report that includes the current cryptocurrencies on the trading market and how these currencies can be grouped together to create a classification system for the new investment portfolio.

To accomplish this analysis, we must first preprocess the targeted dataset which can then be fit into a clustering algorithm (K-means). Once we run our unsupervised machine learning models, data visualizations can be generated to share our findings.

## Features and Data Resources
---
- Data Source: `crypto_data.csv`
- Data Tools: `Pandas`, `sklearn library`, `PCA algorithm`, `K-means algorithm`, `Plotly Express`, `Hvplot`
- Software: `Python 3.9.2`, `Jupyter Notebook`

## Challenge Deliverables 
---
-  Deliverable 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA
-  Deliverable 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
-  Deliverable 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
-  Deliverable 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
