# Cryptocurrencies
Utilizing Unsupervised Machine Learning techniques to analyze cryptocurrency data 
---

## Challenge Overview
---
This project implements unsupervised machine learning to create an analysis for prospective clients preparing to dive into the cryptocurrency market. The client, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolo for its customers. To provide clarification on the crypto universe to our client, we must create a report that includes the current cryptocurrencies on the trading market and how these currencies can be grouped together to create a classification system for the new investment portfolio.

To accomplish this analysis, we must first preprocess the targeted dataset which can then be fit into a clustering algorithm (K-means). Once we run our unsupervised machine learning models, data visualizations can be generated to share our findings.
